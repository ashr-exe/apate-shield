# **ApateShield**  

🚦 *Unmasking the Deception in Deep Learning* 🚦  

ApateShield is an innovative project exploring the vulnerabilities of deep learning models in traffic sign recognition systems when faced with adversarial attacks. Leveraging **InceptionNet**, this project delves into the stark difference between predictions under normal and adversarial conditions.  

With a sleek **Streamlit interface**, it’s as much about interaction as it is about education. You’ll not only see how adversarial attacks work but also test a robust adversarially trained model built to resist them.

## **✨ Key Features**  

- **🔍 Model Training**: Fine-tuned InceptionNet for recognizing traffic signs.  
- **⚔️ Adversarial Attacks**: Implementation of FGSM, PGD, and BIM methods.  
- **🛡️ Adversarial Training**: Builds a defense-ready model to counter adversarial attacks.  
- **📊 Interactive Visuals**: Explore and compare results through a Streamlit app.

## **📚 Usage Guide**  

1. **📂 Download the Dataset**  
   - Get the Traffic Signs Dataset: [Traffic Signs Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pkdarabi/cardetection).  
   - Extract it into the `data` directory.  

2. **🤖 Train Models**  
   - Use the training scripts to build both a standard and adversarially robust model.  
   - Save the models as `best_model.pth` and `adversarial_model.pth` in the project root.  

3. **🌐 Launch the Streamlit App**  
   ```bash  
   streamlit run app.py  
   ```  

4. **🎮 Interact with the App**  
   - Upload traffic sign images or use existing ones.  
   - Experiment with various attack methods.  
   - Visualize predictions and compare results between models.
